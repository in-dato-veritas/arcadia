*Arcadia should be built on top of four key modules: Data Warehouse, Knowledge Machine, Digital Profile, and Economics. Economics is a layer of logic that defines how money is going to flow within Arcadia.*

# Purpose

Arcadia should be **financially self-sustainable**, which means that no profits are generated based on the use of data and everything else –apart from operational expenses– is redistributed to users, developers and companies that maintain, use and improve Arcadia. A **new digital economy based on data** should emerge and make new services available like job offers for users, services offered by clients directly to users, research programs for users and developers to enrol, etc. The built-in economic model should **create virtuous circles** where participants benefit from the activity other participants and by doing so make Arcadia better for everyone. It should also be possible to accelerate the **social innovation through decentralisation** and obtain a broader perspective on societies and how they work.

# Why using cryptocurrencies?

Advantages to use cryptocurrencies within Arcadia:

* It is a borderless, decentralised and unique way of payment.
* It allows Arcadia to be independent, existing only in the digital jurisdiction.
* It can be used both as a mean of exchange and as a unit of measure in very elaborate objective way, combining standard payments with data management, validation process, computing execution, crowdsourcing or crowdfunding mechanisms, etc.

Disadvantages to use cryptocurrencies within Arcadia:

* It is slow.
* It is not mature.
* It can be insecure if not done properly.

What tokens could be used:

* A stablecoin to get paid for the use of the data in order to remove the incentives to hold the token instead in the hope of an appreciation in price instead of using it.
* An Arcadia token for governance, staking mechanism, participation reward, bounties.

# Put a price on your data

> The value of personal data should reflect how well the data represents the user, not a proxy for how much information was gathered about the user.

Things to consider to define the behaviour of the `price characteristic` parameter:

* Define a single unit of measurement for what will be exchanged between users and companies, i.e the price of a characteristic should respond to a standardised valuation algorithm.
* Any algorithm should pass a test based on a `validation process` to ensure a minimum quality for every characteristic.
* Quality should be valued over quantity: a characteristic should be available to use after its representativeness of the population of users in Arcadia has been validated by `statistical tests`.
* Characteristics don't have a fixed price but rather a minimum and a maximum price, each one depending on several factors.
  * A `minimum price` exists to ensure that Arcadia is financially self-sustainable. It should also be used to set a threshold for the `minimum quality performance` of a characteristic.
  * A `maximum price` exist to limit financial gains in one characteristic and push innovation in looking for new opportunities. It should also mean that no further improvement on a particular characteristic could be done.
* Each characteristic should have a different price, but a global `O&M expenses` should be included into `price characteristic` in order to ensure Arcadia's financial self-sustainability.
* Some users will have better data that others and therefore their characteristics are likely to be used more. Their should nevertheless exist an `negative pricing parameter`in order to limit the difference between what one particular user can earn from its characteristics and what all the other users earn.

Possible trends that the `price characteristic` could follow:
* **Upwards trend**: when only few users have the data to pass the `validation process` for a characteristic (i.e `robustness`is low), `price characteristic` is close to `minimum price`. This has the consequence of putting the quality in par with the price of a characteristic, up to the point where `maximum price` is reached.
* **Downwards trend**: when only few users have the data to pass the `validation process` for a characteristic (i.e `robustness`is low), `price characteristic` is close to `maximum price`. This has the advantage that more time will be put into discovering new characteristics than into incrementally improve them.
