*Thanks for your interest in contributing! At the moment, Arcadia is a concept that we are working on. We need you because we don't have all the skills we need to build Arcadia and because it is important to have feedback when the project is about building a public infrastructure.*

*If you have any question please do not hesitate to contact us at hello@seemplr.com so that we can put you in touch with the community.*

# Improve the documentation

You can see in the [open issues](https://github.com/in-dato-veritas/arcadia/issues) what are the documents that need work. Use the **labels** to identify what you can handle. When you're done proofreading a document, please create a new branch and name it `label-your-name` to do a pull request.

If you feel like improving the content of one of the documents, please create a new branch to do a pull request.

# Make a suggestion about how to build Arcadia

At the moment, the [four modules of Arcadia](https://github.com/in-dato-veritas/arcadia/tree/master/modules) are lists of requirements and functionalities that we believe will be necessary in order to build Arcadia. If you want to work on the technical stuff, this is how to do it:

1. You can update the list of requirements and functionalities that you believe are missing, or change the already existing requirement or functionality that you believe could be better defined.
2. You can propose a way to do it by adding a description of how it can be done. Please provide some references if you can and examples if there are any.

Here are quick links to the four modules of Arcadia:

* The [Data Warehouse](https://github.com/in-dato-veritas/arcadia/blob/master/modules/data-warehouse.md) is about how data is uploaded and stored.
* The [Knowledge Machine](https://github.com/in-dato-veritas/arcadia/blob/master/modules/knowledge-machine.md) is about extracting knowledge from the data.
* The [Digital Profile](https://github.com/in-dato-veritas/arcadia/blob/master/modules/digital-profile.md) is about visualising and sharing the data.
* The [Underlying Economics](https://github.com/in-dato-veritas/arcadia/blob/master/modules/underlying-economics.md) is about pricing the data and building the new digital economy.

Thanks for your future contribution!
