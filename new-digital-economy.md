# The Economy of Arcadia

Under the assumption that data will provide a large portion of the raw material the economy of the 21st century will need, it is worth thinking about data beyond simply a byproduct of our online activity. Data is generated everywhere, it can be used multiple times, without wearing out, in different situations and for different purposes. Data should be treated as a commodity that, given the right infrastructure, can establish the foundations of a new digital economy. Foreseeable issues such as the lack of scarcity and a potential extreme volatility should be handled with correct economic incentives and fair pricing mechanisms.

## Fundamentals of economy

Let us start with some basic economics in order to clarify some key concepts that will be important to understand when designing Arcadia. Put together, [the four modules of Arcadia](https://github.com/in-dato-veritas/arcadia/tree/master/modules) should constitute a public infrastructure that will allow a new digital economy to start. Highly recommended

An economy works when needs are satisfied by goods and services in exchange for something of relatively rare value that everyone recognises and accepts, i.e money. There are three fundamental ingredients to an economy: supply, demand and money. The first two are physical and only exist because someone or something creates them or wants them. Money is virtual and only exists because [everybody believes it has value](http://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens/).

* Demand for goods and services: this is where the need for food or counsel comes from.
* Supply of goods and services: this is where the stuff we need or we didn't know exist comes from.
* Money: this is how we pay for the goods and services.

Note that money (whether that is Dollar, Euro, etc) has its own supply and demand. Other types of money can usually be used to acquire it (e.g. to change Euros for Dollars). In order to qualify, what is used as money must have three properties:

* Money must represent a unit of value:
* Money must be a medium of exchange:
* Money must have a unit of measure:

Goods and services compete with one another for the money that is available in the economy. And if need be, they can switch from one form of money to another (like selling a toothbrush in Euro or Yuan). But in modern economies, there is no direct link between the creation of goods and services and the amount of money available in the economy. Besides the brief experiment with the gold standard that will be further discussed below, money has never been issued proportionally with the amount of goods or services available in the economy. An illustration of this is the fact that [there is fewer cash in circulation than there are assets that can be bought](http://money.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/) in the global economy ($90 trillions vs. $800 trillions).

## Blockchain brings new tools to the economy

That was until blockchain technologies like Ethereum offered an alternative to how money is issued. The process is called tokenisation and it offers a way to digitally represent goods or services. Tokenising something means to combine the creation of goods or services and the creation of a unit of value (i.e. a token or money).

AirBnB or Uber are examples of services that give value to goods that already existed but didn't have a market value (e.g. the spare room you never used already existed but didn't have value because there was no market to offer it to someone). Yet it simply made more goods available to the economy, putting more pressure on competing goods and services that existed before. Creating new markets for goods that have latent value don't affect the supply of money.

Tokenising an asset is something that has become very easy with blockchain technologies, assuming of course that the process of tokenisation is done properly, that the token can take control of the underlying asset (e.g to transfer ownership) and that there is a way to enforce in the physical world what happens to the token in the digital world. Assuming those conditions are met, one interesting way to use the token is to use the value of the asset behind the token to issue money. In economy, the asset is called collateral.

## Create your own economy

What if we could create goods, tokenise them and use them as collateral to create new money? The process of tokenisation only works if there is value in what is tokenised, which is called the collateral. The collateral may already have value before being tokenised (like a house or a car), but in other cases it might not have (like with data for instance). In this case, the token acquire value when the asset is tokenised. Because there is no previous value for the underlying asset, its value must be calculated. If goods and services are priced in the new token, then its value can be derived, but especially at the begging, this is unlikely to happen. When a new token is issued and the underlying asset didn't have a market value before, what is created is a whole new economy. In doing so, it is important to specify the utility of the token but also the mechanics that will manage the supply and demand of tokens.

One immediate problem arises when the underlying asset doesn't have value before it is tokenised (e.g data) as it will then be fairly easy for anybody to tokenise it (i.e generating data in abundance is cheap). If this could be done then the token wouldn't be able to keep its value for very long as the supply of tokens would be increasing too fast with respect to the demand.

### Markets need scarcity

An important parameter to consider when choosing a collateral to issue tokens is its scarcity. If we were to tokenise gold, and we knew there was only a limited amount of gold available that can be extracted, then we also know that at some point, we won't be able to issue new tokens anymore. Data on the other hand is not scarce, it is infinitely abundant (although there are some limitations like storage, processing power, etc) and so issuing new tokens will always be a possibility. Both scenarios are equally bad: in the case of gold, the growth of the economy is limited by the amount of gold; in the case of data, it would allow people to get free money that would almost immediately lose its value.

What would be the result of tokenising an abundant asset like data and use it as collateral in order to issue money? It would mean that the more of this asset is produce, the more money is made available to the economy. And if anybody can produce the asset, it also means that the more productive people are, the more money they get. If there is no market force that act against the increase of the supply of money, the price at which there is demand for that asset will go down. No economy would be functioning, as pricing things like food or movie tickets would never make sense. There would be enormous volatility and prices would need to fluctuate all the time to adjust to the money supply.

But, if the asset that is tokenised get relatively scarce through time, or if the tokenising process gets more difficult, the rate at which new money is made available to the economy should decrease. There could even have mechanisms by which the supply of tokens is negatively affected by taking tokens out of circulation. Still, volatility would remain an issue, but to a lesser extent.

### Price volatility

Ideally, we would like to have an easy way to create value, issue new tokens in the process and be able to spend those tokens on goods and services that we need at predictable prices, independently of where these are available or in which economy they're sold. In other words, in every economy, there is always a need for a form of money which design principles stability. In economics, this is called a stable currency or, in the blockchain space, a stablecoin.

A stablecoin is stable because the volume being traded or used (i.e. the circulation of money) is so large that changes in the demand or supply of money is irrelevant to its price. Another reason for a token to remain stable is because of stabilising mechanisms that incentivise the behaviour of people to take advantage of market signals and by doing so, they actually participate in stabilising the token price.

With the advent of blockchain technologies, it is possible to create new forms of money that uses assets as collateral to issue tokens and along with it, a set of rules that ensure the stability of its price. This is especially useful when a newly created economy is still small, because at this stage speculative behaviours are dominant.

### Soft and hard currency

There is still the question of whether one or several currencies should on economy use in order to be as efficient as possible. For a brief moment in time (1880â€“1918), two currencies existed at the same time and within the same economy. It was an experiment called [the gold standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard) that was completely abandoned by Nixon in 1971. During that period, fiat currencies like the Dollar, the Franc or the Peseta were the hard currencies, which value was relatively stable with respect to the gold or silver, or the soft currency, which value was [more volatile](http://www.commoditytrademantra.com/gold-trading-news/gold-and-silver-rally-to-resume-from-around-26th-sept-expect-volatility-till-then/).

It was abandoned because of its lack of flexibility in an economy that was growing fast: the rate at which assets were given value exceeded the amount of gold or silver that could be obtained to back the cash that needed to be issued. Even today it still is a debated topic in economy, but it is fair to say that it had the benefit of separating the liquidity in the economy from the assets that served as collateral to issue the money. Note that the lack of flexibility is now easily programmed in softwares like the blockchain. It is therefore perfectly imaginable to build new economies where the tokenised asset that is issued as collateral is separated from the tokens that are issued based on this collateral and that is used for everyday activities.

### TL;DR

* An economy needs three fundamental elements: supply, demand and money.
* Money itself has its own supply and demand.
* In modern economies, the issuance of money was never dependent on existing assets that could be used as collateral.
* Through a tokenisation process, blockchain allows anyone to use any type of collateral for the issuance of new money.
* It is fundamental for the underlying asset to be relatively scarce in order to be used as collateral for the token to retain its value and to allow markets to exist.
* Splitting the currency in two so that liquidity and hard assets can be governed by separate mechanisms makes sense in order to have stabilising mechanisms that allow prices to remain predictable.

## Paradigm shift, the new digital economy

Data is a digital asset that everyone can generate and that people, companies and machines are demanding at a growing pace. Nowadays data is considered a product that is generated as a byproduct of some online activity. It is usually used on the same platform it has been generated by or else it is sold in the economy. What if, instead, data was considered an asset that could be plugged into an infrastructure because it bring more value to the user? What if by committing her data to this economy, she now gets access to a range of products and services that couldn't have existed before. What if based on the value of the token that represent her data, she could now see how valuable her contribution was to the community. And what if, finally, as more people, companies and machines are using her data, she could expect return on her commitment to this economy?

### Data as collateral or soft currency

Data is your entry ticket to the economy of Arcadia. Tokenised data is used as a form of collateral to issue a certain amount of Arc tokens, calculated at the time of the tokenisation process. Once tokenised data has been committed to Arcadia as collateral, it means it can be put to work. At any time, if the user decides to get out of Arcadia, the access to the data can be revoked by paying back the amount of Arc tokens that was issued in the first place. Arc tokens are essentially recognising data as personal property within the economy of Arcadia, like any other property she might have (house, stocks, car, etc), in the form of a soft currency. The same way personal assets can potentially generates income, data as a fundamental asset in the digital economy should be allowed the same capability.

The Arc token the user receives in exchange for locking her data in the Arcadian economy act as a digital representation of her asset. The user needs Arc token to become part of this economy. The more data is locked, the more tokens she gets. As long as the user remains interested in using Arcadia to exploit the potential of her data, there shouldn't be any reason to withdraw Arc tokens from Arcadia, although this is perfectly possible to do. But the moment the user decides to withdraw her Arc tokens from Arcadia, she loses her rights as a member of Arcadia: her data becomes unusable and she stops earning dividends.

### Dividends as stablecoin or hard currency

Once data has been has been committed to Arcadia and Arc tokens were issued and transferred to the user, data can be put to work. Which means that each time the data is used in a service sold by an institution to a client, dividends are generated and transferred to the user.

If the same token was used for paying dividends and tokenising the data, prices in the economy of Arcadia would not be predictable and no economy could ever exist. This is the reason why the liquidity the economy of Arcadia should rely on a stable form of money or hard currency. That way, costs, prices, incomes, benefits, investments or collaborations rewards can be predictable and estimated between the participants of the economy of Arcadia.

Fully implementing a stablecoin in Arcadia would mean to use tokenised data (Arc tokens) as collateral to issue new stablecoins. This would allow users to use their Arc tokens without the need to move them from Arcadia. But it is also possible to keep the two cryptocurrencies separate from each other.

### Enter the new realm of data

So why hasn't this been done sooner? It could have been, but there were lots of reasons not to. First, building a public, decentralised, neutral, open source infrastructure for personal data was quite a challenge with the technologies available. As blockchain technologies mature, this is now a possibility. Another reason is that there wasn't any economic incentive to do it. The general economic framework under which *web2* was built came form the "command and conquer" era. An [era](https://github.com/in-dato-veritas/arcadia/blob/master/public-reach-out.md) in which the digital space was seen as a new land to invade (e.g people's attention) and a lot resources to gather (e.g personal data).

The economy of Arcadia will change the rules of the game as far as data is concerned. Suddenly, there is no more debate about how much data should be worth or what strategy to use in order to increase its market value. Now the value of worth as an asset becomes a function of its richness (rich data as opposed to big data), and the value it can generate becomes a function of its utility.

Data should free to join whatever community serves it best. The economy of Arcadia is not a silo, it is built on data portability design principles where data can be committed in order to access the economy. Arcadia offers a way to recognise the value of the data and an infrastructure governed, maintained and improved by its users and to which many applications can connect and make use of it.

### TL;DR

* Users would commit their data to Arcadia by tokenising them in the form of Arc, which would then be used as collateral to issue a stablecoin that can be used in anyway the user see fit.
* As long as the Arc token remains in Arcadia, every time her data is used, she earns dividends in the form of a stablecoin.
* The value of Arc tokens in general is likely to fluctuate and there should be mechanism that ensure scarcity of the Arc tokens.
* Whenever the user wants to get out of Arcadia, she has to pay back the amount of stablecoin that was issued in order to get the control over her Arc tokens back.
* Once she withdrawn her Arc tokens from Arcadia, her data can no longer be used and she stops earning dividends from the use of her data.
