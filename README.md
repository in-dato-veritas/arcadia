*This document is an introduction to the project we're currently developing. Its purpose is to highlight why Arcadia is important and how we might actually be able to build it. After we receive enough feedback from the community, detailed technical documentation will follow. For the time being, we'd like to encourage the community to join the discussion.*

# Why do we need Arcadia?

Arcadia is an open source infrastructure meant to control your personal data, learn from it, and put it to work.

# How is Arcadia built?

Arcadia has the potential to put users in control of their personal data. It should allow each user to have access to a personal data warehouse. Each data warehouse will have the possibility to share its content to specific user or group of users and for specific reasons.

As data doesn't leave Arcadia, economic incentives should be designed for developers to extract value from the data without actually being able to access the data. This will also benefit the users as they will get access to new knowledge about themselves through their data.

# What to do with Arcadia?

With the new infrastructure, a new digital economy of services based on personal data can be envisioned. An economy not necessarily based on money transfer and more on the exchange of knowledge. An economy that can help to get to a higher level of self consciousness as well as to a fair collaboration between users, developers, companies and clients.

# Go deeper into Arcadia

To get a general overview of the concepts behind Arcadia, we recommend to start by reading though the [Public Reach Out](https://github.com/in-dato-veritas/arcadia/blob/master/modules/public-reach-out.md) document.

To start building the four key modules Arcadia will sit on, a list of expected requirements and functionalities has been laid down in four separate files. As progress is made, these will be turned into formal specifications.

* The [Data Warehouse](https://github.com/in-dato-veritas/arcadia/blob/master/modules/data-warehouse.md) is about how data is uploaded and stored.
* The [Knowledge Machine](https://github.com/in-dato-veritas/arcadia/blob/master/modules/knowledge-machine.md) is about extracting knowledge from the data.
* The [Digital Profile](https://github.com/in-dato-veritas/arcadia/blob/master/modules/digital-profile.md) is about visualising and sharing the data.
* The [Underlying Economics](https://github.com/in-dato-veritas/arcadia/blob/master/modules/underlying-economics.md) is about pricing the data and building the new digital economy.
