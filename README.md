*This document is an introduction to the project we're currently developing. Its purpose is to highlight why Arcadia is important and how we might actually be able to build it. After we receive enough feedback from the community, detailed technical documentation will follow. For the time being, we'd like to encourage the community to join the discussion.*

# Executive summary

## Why do we need Arcadia?

Arcadia is an **open source public infrastructure** meant to privately control your personal data, learn from it, and put it to work. It is the first step necessary for the creation of a **new digital economy**. It can be considered new because it relies on **core values** that are substantially different from what we are used to when we think about digital technologies.

## How is Arcadia built?

Arcadia has the potential to put users in control of their personal data. It should allow each user to have access to a personal **data warehouse**. Each data warehouse will have the possibility to share its content to specific user or group of users and for specific reasons.

As data doesn't leave Arcadia, **economic incentives** should be designed for developers to extract value from the data without actually being able to access the data. This will also benefit the users as they will get access to new knowledge about themselves through their data.

## What to do with Arcadia?

With the new infrastructure, a **new digital economy** of services based on personal data can be envisioned. An economy not necessarily based on money transfer but also on the exchange of knowledge. An economy that can help to get to a higher level of self consciousness and to facilitate a fair collaboration between users, developers, institutions and clients.

# Go deeper into Arcadia

To get a general overview of the concepts behind Arcadia, we recommend to start by reading our [Public Reach Out](https://github.com/in-dato-veritas/arcadia/blob/master/public-reach-out.md).

To build Arcadia, a list of expected requirements and functionalities has been laid down in four separate files. As progress is made, these list will be turned into a formal specification type of files.

* The [Data Warehouse](https://github.com/in-dato-veritas/arcadia/blob/master/modules/data-warehouse.md) is about how data is uploaded and stored.
* The [Knowledge Machine](https://github.com/in-dato-veritas/arcadia/blob/master/modules/knowledge-machine.md) is about extracting knowledge from the data.
* The [Digital Profile](https://github.com/in-dato-veritas/arcadia/blob/master/modules/digital-profile.md) is about visualising and sharing the data.
* The [Underlying Economics](https://github.com/in-dato-veritas/arcadia/blob/master/modules/underlying-economics.md) is about pricing the data and building the new digital economy.
