*Arcadia will be built on top of four key modules: Data Warehouse, Knowledge Machine, Digital Profile and Underlying Economics. The Data Warehouse will enable all the functionalities Arcadia will have.*
GENERAL COMMENT: THE TERM "USER" IS USED FOR EVERYONE (PEOPLE WHO UPLOAD,ANALYSE AND USE THE DATA). MAYBE SPECIFIC TERMS COULD BE USED TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENT "USERS" TO AVOID LOTS OF CONFUSION/COMPLICATED SENTENCES TO DEAL WITH THE CONFUSION? FOR EXAMPLE, TERMS SUCH AS "DATA PROVIDERS" COULD BE USED FOR THE PEOPLE UPLOADING DATA; "DATA ANALYSTS" FOR DEVELOPERS; "DATA CLIENTS" FOR THOSE BUYING A SERVICE?
# Purpose

The Data Warehouse covers the **data management** of Arcadia, from the moment users upload data to the moment users grant other users or developers access to it. It is a **private space** for the user to store and access his data. The availability and reliability of the service should not rely on trusting a third party, but rather on a **decentralised infrastructure** where incentives exist to always maintain the service live, regardless of the value or the sensitivity of the data stored. Trust in the infrastructure, privacy around personal data and control over permissions will be core values of the Data Warehouse and by extension of Arcadia. It is paramount to show that, whether working directly or indirectly with personal data, these values are always ensured.

# Preconditions

Users, developers and institutions should be able to trust and check – if they so wish – that the material found in Arcadia is truly authentic, meaning that:

* The data uploaded by the user is actually his.
* A user who accesses information about a group of users should be certain that he is using real data about real users and that the data is representative of the users it is coming from. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "REPRESENTATIVE"?
* The answer that a user gets from a service that uses the information from another user must be verified as being aligned with `quality standards` that are accepted by the community.

# Uploading data

The process of uploading data must follow a protocol of validation to ensure the quality of the data and therefore the quality of the results. The protocol should include:

* A way to confirm the origin of the data by asking for multiple sources of the same data. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS SENTENCE?
* Algorithms capable of recognising patterns of data manipulation.
* A period during which the data is validated and where the user can lose reputation and/or money if he intentionally uploaded data that did not pass a standard quality test. HOW DIFFICULT TO PROVE IT WAS INTENTIONAL?
* A `certification mechanism` whereby other users could validate the data of a user. HERE, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVING SPECIFIC NAMES FOR VARIOUS USERS WOULD MAKE SENSE.
* A way to communicate directly with the source of data through e.g an API and therefore a way to establish the reputation (VALIDITY?) for the different sources of data.

# Storing data

* It would be extremely imprudent and paradoxical for Arcadia to physically store the data from all OF Arcadia's users.
* The service used for storing data should be easily upgradable and switching to another service should not cause any problems.
* A `reputation score` (QUALITY SCORE?) for each dataset should be available as a way to evaluate the quality of raw data.

# Using data

The user is the sole owner of his data warehouse and therefore when someone or something wants to use his data, a permission must be granted.

* The user is the only person allowed to give, modify or cancel access to his data.
* By default, the data remains only visible to the user.
* The identity that is behind the data can be revealed or not but by default it is not revealed.(DATA PROVIDERS CAN REVEAL THEIR IDENTITY, BUT BY DEFAULT IDENTITY IS NOT REVEALED?)
* As the owner of his data, a user can decide to grant permission to someone else to access his raw data or only to his digital profile (see DIGITAL PROFILE module).
* The purpose for which a user's data or his digital profile will be used should be agreed upon before access to the data is granted.
