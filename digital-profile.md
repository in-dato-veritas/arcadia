*Arcadia should be built on top of four key modules: Data Warehouse, Knowledge Machine, Digital Profile, and Economics. The Digital Profile is a way for the user to visualise and manage the data stored in his data warehouse in a human readable format.*

# Purpose

The Digital Profile module describes how to **build a digital profile** for the user based on the raw data he uploaded to the Data Warehouse. For users to interact with their digital profile in a human readable format, good **data visualisation** is going to be specified in this module. The Digital Profile is also the place from which the user should be able to **get information about his data** in terms of economic value, interest from developers, offers to use it from companies, offers to collaborate, results achieved, etc. Finally, the Digital Profile module should handle the functionality of **sharing the digital profile** with other users, developers or companies. Users should be allowed to specify the terms and conditions whereby they agree to share their digital profile, as well as to whom, for how long, etc.

# Constituents

When new data is uploaded by the user to the data warehouse or when a new interpretation of the data is performed by the developers, it is extremely important that both the user and the developer agree on the way the digital profile should be affected. Exchange of information, feedback, comments, questions and answers should be encouraged along the process of creating the digital profile for the users.

The value of the data fundamentally depends on the [context](https://medium.com/@giorgialupi/data-humanism-the-revolution-will-be-visualized-31486a30dbfb) in which is was generated, therefore it is paramount to never lose that context when the data is uploaded or used in Arcadia. For that reason a distinction must be made between **data and metadata**, and a hierarchy should exist when conclusions are drawn. One way to do it could be the following:

> DATA > VARIABLES > CHARACTERISTICS > FACETS > PERSONALITY

Where each step is another level of abstraction from the raw data itself and therefore has meaning and consequences. The personality is composed of several facets that are composed of characteristics that are composed of variables that use raw data. Characteristics are the critical elements of the digital profile because they constitute the most basic level of interpretation of the digital profile of a user.

# Visualisation

* The validation process of the data uploaded by the user should inform him about the potential earnings his data can get him, or the potential utility his data has to some specific project.

# Dashboard of information

* Economic value of the data
* Interest from developers to work the data
* Offers from companies to use the data
* Offers from other users to collaborate on a projects
* Results that were achieved thanks to the data (like research projects)

# Sharing your profile

Users are offered different modalities to manage their data in Arcadia, so that users has full control over the access to their data.

* By default, the option of not sharing anything with anyone is activated.
* If the user decides to put their personal data to work, he can choose if he wants to reveal his identity or if he prefers to remain anonymous.
* The user decides if he wants to share his raw data or only the characteristics of his profile.
* The user decides the terms and conditions with which he shares some characteristics of his profile.
* The user decides with whom he wants to share some characteristics of his profile.
